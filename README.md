## üöÄ Projects

### Professional Projects

#### [Deqave](https://deqave.lazuweb.my.id/)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the cafe business, I was assigned to create a POS application. It aims to minimize customer contact and movement, facilitating faster and more accurate ordering and bookkeeping processes. This app enables the cafe to adapt efficiently and make data-driven decisions while complying with gathering restrictions.

#### [LMS Expression Recognition Integration](https://skripsi.lazuweb.my.id/)
In my undergraduate thesis, I integrated expression recognition with the LMS (Learning Management System) to address asynchronous learning's weakness in understanding student's facial expressions. This system enables teachers to assess student's comprehension without synchronous meetings, enhancing distance learning effectiveness.

#### [Freshchubs Stock Opname System](/)
Freshchubs needs an efficient solution for their manual stock taking process leading to inaccuracies and time-consuming warehousing due to a large number of orders. I developed a user-friendly digital system to tackle this issue. The application allows easy operation, improves bookkeeping, and provides real-time stock data accuracy, ensuring client satisfaction.
